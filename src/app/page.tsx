    title: "Background",
    content: [
      "Happy Chicks is a small-sized poultry-focused farm in the Oti Region of Ghana. The farm specializes in the production of table eggs, supported by occasional broiler production for festive seasons. Additionally, the farm keeps other animals, including pigs, goats, cattle, and sheep. Its main focus, however, is raising laying hens.",
      "The farm operates with 5 sheds capable of holding up to 12,000 birds at full capacity but currently manages 5,400 birds using the deep litter system. The business employs 8 workers, including a manager, to oversee daily operations such as feeding, egg collection, grading, and sales.",
      "The farm currently relies on a manual record-keeping system, which involves workers logging egg collections, feed allocation, mortality rates, and broken egg records in notebooks. However, this approach has proven inadequate as the farm seeks to grow and modernize its operations."
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Defining the Problem",
    content: [
      "The farm faces several challenges in its daily operations, including:",
      "1. Theft and Accountability Issues: Lack of proper monitoring systems allow for potential theft of feed, eggs, and other resources. No real-time tracking of inventory and sales.",
      "2. Errors in Record-Keeping: Manual records are prone to mistakes due to worker errors in recording and calculating data. The current method makes it difficult to analyze trends such as lay rates, broken egg percentages, and mortality.",
      "3. Inefficient Processes: Workers spend significant time manually recording and totaling data at the end of the day. The process is time-consuming and detracts from other farm activities.",
      "4. Limited Scalability: The manual system cannot efficiently handle the farm's potential growth to full capacity (12,000 birds).",
      "5. Lack of Real-Time Insights: The manager must wait until the end of the day to access farm-wide data, delaying decisions and actions."
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Aim",
    content: [
      "The aim of this project is to design and develop an automated farm management system tailored to the needs of Happy Chicks. The system will streamline operations, enhance accuracy in record-keeping, and provide real-time data insights. By integrating features for inventory tracking, egg production monitoring, and employee accountability, the system will improve operational efficiency, reduce theft, and position the farm for sustainable growth."

    title: "Objectives",
    content: [
      "1. Automate Record-Keeping: Develop a user-friendly application to record and calculate egg production, feed allocation, broken eggs, and mortality rates automatically.",
      "2. Enhance Accountability: Implement features to track employee activities and reduce theft.",
      "3. Improve Data Accuracy: Minimize human errors through automated data entry and calculation systems.",
      "4. Real-Time Monitoring: Provide the manager with real-time access to farm data, including inventory, production rates, and employee performance.",
      "5. Enable Scalability: Design the system to handle increased capacity as the farm grows.",
      "6. Generate Reports: Include functionalities to generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports on egg production, broken eggs, and feed usage."
